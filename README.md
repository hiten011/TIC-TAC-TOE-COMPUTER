# TICK-TAC-TOE-Computer
Tic-Tac-Toe Game (MATLAB) This game I developed for my Matlab project. You can choose to play in multiplayer mode or challenge yourself in single-player mode against the computer. The single-player mode offers three difficulty levels: Easy Medium Nightmare

Feel free to explore, improve your strategy, and see if you can beat the computer on the hardest level!
